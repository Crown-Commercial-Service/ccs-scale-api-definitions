  version: "0.0.2"
  description: This API allows access to CCS Commercial Agreement data. This is used both to provide information to users and to govern the behaviour of other systems for example 'Buy a Thing' and 'Contract for a Thing', where processes may differ based on the configuration of the underlying Commercial Agreement and Lot.

# Some data is explicitly omitted from the initial version of the API. Some detailed notes below but a summary here
# - Terms and conditions are not included (in MVP) as individual data items. It is assumed that a link to a t&cs document will be provided for all Agreements. To be considered post MVP.

# TODO:
# 1. calls to manage data e.g. POST agreement, lot; PUT modifications and so on
# 2. Questions that need to be answered by suppliers on registration (for Evidence Locker) - talk to
# 3. CaT data - RFx question lists per lot
# 4. Implement security when Conclave or other Auth in place. Commented out for now

 # The get-agreement-detail call explicitly omits CPV codes in the initial version. These will be added later if required. As there are potentially thousands of CPV codes it was felt that these would overwhelm the output and management of the underlying data.
